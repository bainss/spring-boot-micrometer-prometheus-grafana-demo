#Use "*" to expose all endpoints, or a comma-separated list to expose selected ones i.e. health,info
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
# Use "*" to expose all endpoints, or a comma-separated list to expose selected ones
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=*
#To get the complete details including the status of every health indicator that was checked as part of the health
#check-up process, add the following property
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
# To configure the severity order, add the following property to your application properties
management.health.status.order=FATAL, DOWN, OUT_OF_SERVICE, UNKNOWN, UP
#The HTTP status code in the response reflects the overall health status (for example, UP maps to 200,
#while OUT_OF_SERVICE and DOWN map to 503). You might also want to register custom status mappings if you access the
#health endpoint over HTTP. For example, the following property maps FATAL to 503 (service unavailable)
management.health.status.http-mapping.FATAL=503
# following InfoContributor beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot - EnvironmentInfoContributor, GitInfoContributor, BuildInfoContributor
# It is possible to disable them all by setting the management.info.defaults.enabled property.

# Customize management endpoints i.e. from /actuator to /abc by using management.endpoints.web.base-path=/abc

# Customize management endpoints port  by using management.server.port=8989

# Disable management endpoints either by using management.server.port=-1 OR management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*

# By default, metrics are generated with the name http.server.requests.
# You can customize the name by setting the management.metrics.web.server.requests-metric-name property
